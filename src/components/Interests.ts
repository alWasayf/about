        <p>This might not be as popular as the Sacred Lotus that is more often seen in cultivation. But these flowers provide a blanket of elegance thanks to their pure white petals and a yellow center. They grow up to 12 inches across and are a sight to behold. It is a marginal aquatic perennial that also produces large umbrella-like leaves. They are native to eastern North America. </p>
